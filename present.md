# Money like bags of chips
Hunnits of bags I flip
Finger-licking with the ranch

# Leaving crumbs on your lips
Truckload backin' up (beep)
New shipment, gotta stack 'em up

# Bag look magical
Mmm, mmm, Good and smackable
Number one record, the chip breaking record so add it up

# Trappin' 'em out the gas stations
Customers, customers lined up
I heard that you hungry and you make your mind up

# Don't grab a Snickers and go get a bag of 'em
Bag of what? Dab of Ranch
What's with the ranch?, just a lil dab

# Just give me a bag (Get me some)
'Cause I'm bout to smash
Give me some out that bag
Just get your own you'll be glad
