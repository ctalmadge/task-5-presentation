# I saw history in a poetâ€™s song,

# In a river-reach and a gallows-hill,

# In a bridal bed, and a secret wrong,

# In a crown of thorns: in a daffodil.

# I imagined measureless time in a day,

# And starry space in a waggon-road,

# And the treasure of all good harvests lay

# In the single seed that the sower sowed.

# My garden-wind had driven and havened again

# All ships that ever had gone to sea,

# And I saw the glory of all dead men

# In the shadow that went by the side of me.
